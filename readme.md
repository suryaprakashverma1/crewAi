Dwonload docker and then go to running the crewAi docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/seemeai/crewai

run the image from docker UI: remember you should have an open API key, if you don't have local llm model setup for this.

where you can create an new notebook to write python code.


This is how you should setup the local model.
